What is the course that I am taking now?

No haste, no desperation either.

Do I want to take formal education further? 
Yes. I believe it will be something I will enjoy.

Where do you want to do that?
I am thinking of M. Tech. and then M.S./Ph. D.

Do you want to start a startup?
Yes. Can do.

How do you plan to execute it? Now that you are here.
I am not taking gap. Too much of a drag and pressure.

1) I will start doing a job. No big deal (can be a big deal, which will probably be the case. Can lead to a downfall. Which almost has been the case for most of the people. But not you. Not this time).

2) Code. Learn. Do courses. Do solo startup. Add people when it succeeds. Because without this approach it is not going to start. Work on your curiousity.
Physics and stuff.

3) Study for GATE for a job or M. Tech.
